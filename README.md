#### EVAL

The objective of EVAL is to develop a methodology for assessing the performance of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models. This evaluation process is crucial for identifying areas of improvement, thereby guiding optimizations to enhance the overall effectiveness of these models.

If you don't have a groudtruth dataset for eval, check this :point_down:
